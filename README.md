This web application takes two strings as input (String1, String2) and compares them using strcmp function. The output is displayed as which one of the two strings is greater. The function basically compares the ASCII values of the alphabets in both the strings and returns that string whose alphabet's ascii value is higher during comparison

Example 1:

String1: Apple String2: Antelope

Output: string 1 is greater than string 2 (Because p's ascii value is greater than n's)

Example 2:

String1: ball
String2: bella

Output: string 2 is greater than string 1

Example 3:

String 1: app String 2: app

Output: Strings are equal

Future work: To extend the webservice by including an advanced option of encryption and decryption of text. Encryption and decryption is done using AES(Advanced encryption standard) in a secured way. User needs to give the text and we will be displaying text statistics(number of words, number of sentences, uppercase letters, lower case letters etc..) and the number of occurences of any word in inputted text along with Encrypting and decrypting it using AES Standards.
